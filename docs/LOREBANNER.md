# QDRIVE: Lore & Banner Protocol

While the QDRIVE is a serious engineering project, it utilizes a "Mind Prison Warning" narrative as a functional part of the user experience.

---

### I. The Banner Protocol
Because the QDRIVE is hosted behind a VPN with rotating IPs and Ports, users will frequently encounter SSH "Host Key" warnings. To provide a non-technical confirmation of identity, the server displays a specific legal disclaimer (The Mind Prison Warning) upon connection. This serves as the primary way for a user to verify they have reached the legitimate QDRIVE root despite the lack of a consistent security certificate.

---

### II. Deployment & Installation
For the banner to display correctly during the SSH handshake, the `banner.txt` file must be placed in a specific system directory recognized by the OpenSSH service.

* **Physical Path**: `C:\ProgramData\ssh\banner.txt`.
* **Active Configuration**: The `sshd_config` file points to this location using the `Banner` directive.

---

### III. Interdimensional Narrative
The "Mind Prison" logic serves as the project's unique signature.

* **The Space Judge**: An automated interdimensional authority that sentences unauthorized users to "Mind Prison".
* **The Sentence**: 100,000,000 perceived Earth years.
* **Real-Time Duration**: The sentence lasts exactly one natural sleep cycle.
* **Memory Redaction**: Authorities wipe all memory of the event so the user only perceives a "good night's sleep" upon waking.
* **4DGPD Tracking**: The banner logs "Four Dimensional Geographic Positional Data" to ensure Euclidean compliance.

Initiating connection to the QDRIVE...
Success!

!!!! If you have acquired access to the QDRIVE via an 
unauthorized or otherwise illicit source, your 4DGPD 
will now be logged and a space judge will sentence you 
to 100,000,000 years of Mind Prison upon your next 
natural sleeping cycle!!!!
